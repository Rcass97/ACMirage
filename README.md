# Assassin's Creed Mirage Website Reimagined

Assassin's Creed Mirage is an upcoming title from the game studio Ubisoft. Being a fan of the series since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood I am looking forward to the new title releasing in October.

Wanting to learn some more about the game I recently visited the Ubisoft website to view all of the details for AC Mirage.

While the website itself was styled very nicely, fitting the themes of the location of the new game, I am personally not a fan of websites where you have to scroll far down the page to learn more.

This website made by me is a reimagining of the information about the game in a more digestible format, with tabs leading you directly to the new characters and story details.

Wanting to try new frameworks I landed upon Tailwind CSS. This website utilizies Tailwind to the best of my ability.

Please Enjoy! *Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted*
